## Abstract:
Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and prevention are crucial to manage the disease effectively. This study proposes a machine learning-based diabetes prediction system that uses a combination of physiological and lifestyle factors to predict the likelihood of diabetes. The system utilizes supervised learning algorithms to analyze a dataset of patient characteristics and identifies high-risk individuals. The results show that the proposed system achieves high accuracy and precision in predicting diabetes, making it a valuable tool for early detection and prevention. The system can be used by healthcare professionals to identify high-risk patients and provide personalized recommendations for prevention and management."
